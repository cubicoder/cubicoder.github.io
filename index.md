### Welcome to Cubicoder's Minecraft Forge modding tutorials!

This site is meant to help others learn how to mod Minecraft using Forge, as well as learn the concepts behind the code.

### What's different about these tutorials?

These tutorials aim to actually *teach* the concepts behind the code, instead of simply spoonfeeding. It's also a major goal for these tutorials to represent the recommended or "correct" way to do things, as defined by the [official Forge documentation](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and by established convention.
To aid in these goals, this website is actually open source. This means that **anyone** can contribute tutorials to the site (as long as they know what they're talking about). If you're interested in contributing, check out the [repository for the website](https://github.com/cubicoder/cubicoder.github.io).

### Troubleshooting

If you are having troubles with your code:

1. Make sure your code is exactly the same as the tutorial. Check the <a href="https://github.com/cubicoder/tutorialmod">GitHub source</a> to be sure.
2. Leave a comment on the tutorial that you're having troubles with. I try to answer comments as soon as I can, but I'm not always available. Don't give up if I don't answer right away!

Also, providing code and the debug.log file is generally useful for troubleshooting. Please upload code to [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com), [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com), or a similar site, rather than trying to directly paste it into the comment.

If your issue is caused by a lack of Java knowledge, please go learn Java before trying to mod Minecraft! While it is not impossible to learn to write mods without knowing Java first (especially if you have experience with another similar programming language), it makes things much harder! **You have been warned.**

There are myriads of Java tutorials online with varying difficulty levels, which are able to be found with a simple Google search. These will get you through the basics.

### Other Modding Sources

There are loads of other sources out there to learn about modding Minecraft. I've discussed a few of the better ones in [one of my blog posts](https://cubicoder.github.io/other-modding-resources/).

However, it's important to know that many resources out there spread misinformation and bad practices. No website (including this one!) is perfect. At the end of the day, the only truly accurate source for information about Forge is their own [official documentation](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

With that being said, happy modding!
