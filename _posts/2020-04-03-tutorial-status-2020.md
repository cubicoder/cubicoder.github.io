title: Tutorial Status 2020
---

I took the day today to rework all my tutorials, a process I began a while ago (a year? Already? Maybe?). I had been holding off for a while, but I decided to just bite the bullet and do it, since I have plenty of free time now. I also wanted to make sure I was leaving these tutorials in a good place.

So, the purpose of this post is to say that I probably won't be doing any more tutorials. I haven't been really modding in over a year, and I am quickly forgetting everything I have ever learned (as these things go). Minecraft and Forge have both taken a far leap forward since I was still heavily involved with this. Forge no longer supports 1.12.2, with [1.14.4 being on long-term support](https://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/topic/79304-112114-and-lts-system/) and 1.15.2 being the recommended version for modders.

Therefore, I hereby declare that I will be ending this small tutorial series. I hope you all have gotten some good out of it. I will still be around to answer comments as best I can, and of course the site itself will remain up.

Further, I encourage all of you reading this to move to 1.14.4/1.15.2. The Forge team has worked really hard to push forward some excellent improvements to the mod making process. If you're looking for tutorials, [Cadiboo](https://cadiboo.github.io/tutorials/) has a great series, ranging from 1.13 to 1.15. I've looked at his 1.15 tutorials a bit, and they are great. Please check them out!

Not much else here to say, so, without further ado, happy modding!

P.S. The [GitHub](https://github.com/cubicoder/tutorialmod) with all the tutorial code is also updated now, so that's cool
